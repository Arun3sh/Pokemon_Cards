# Pokemon Cards : A place to find all types of pokemon

# [Live Demo](https://searchpokemoncard.netlify.app/)

## Overview
This website is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Here you can search and find all types of pokemon that you ‚ù§

I always wanted to know about the pokemon based on their type and their stats and that's why I created a site to search and find your fvourite pokemon's stat.

Ways you can find your pokemon in this site 
1. You can type in your favourite pokemon's name
2. By entering the pokemon's type (Grass or bug)
3. By clicking on the type icon

  Once you've searched and got the result, you can see the stats of the pokemon with their image. The card displays the pokemon image, its HP and what other type it is. Left side of the card you can find its ability, height, weight and id. Right side you can find defence nd attack points represented in progress bar.
